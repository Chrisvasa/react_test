# React Playground
This is simply a playground to try different things in react and learn while doing it.
## What are you currently working on?
Recent changes to this folder include: 
- A simple way to search between different persons from an API call.
- A one page application where all three pages are on one page with a section to jump down to a given "page"
- And currently working on a small snake game to be played in the browser.


Design is not of great importance during this project. This is mostly to familiarize myself with the differences between React/js and C#.
